## Ed-Cred
### Problem Statement:
Lack of credibility and recognition for students' participation in technical co-curricular activities, including hackathons, online courses, personal projects, etc.
No value placed on certifications received through these activities, except for cash prize.s
Students who prioritize grades over practical knowledge see technical activities as a distraction.
Lack of freelancing culture among college students, who view such work as a waste of time.
Attendance requirements for all students, regardless of their participation in technical activities, leading to inequitable treatment.

### Solution:

Implement a permissioned blockchain-based credit system.
Reward students with tokens for their participation in technical events, hackathons, and personal projects.
This also makes sure the certificates carried by students hold some value and subsequent number of tokens will be rewarded.
Tokens earned can be redeemed for academic credits, attendance, and other benefits based on the scale, complexity, and quality of work.
A review team will evaluate the projects and authorize the token allocation based on their own criteria.
Encourage freelancing culture amongst college students by making tokens transferable between students based on proof of work provided.
Develop an eye catching and a user-friendly website to motivate students to buy into this whole idea smoothly. 
Non-academic tokens can also be earned through participation in sports and cultural events, which can be used for transactions within the college campus.
Tokens can be used for transactions in canteens, parking lots, college merchandise, and stationery shops.
Academic tokens can be converted into non-academic tokens based on a fixed ratio.
Value of tokens and the ratio of conversions will all be determined by the University adopting this system. 
This system will motivate students to participate in technical events and projects and promote a sense of community within the college campus through token-based incentives.
